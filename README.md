# Portfolio-Optimization-Using-Python
 Python project showcasing asset allocation and optimization techniques. It enables users to construct investment portfolios with Bitcoin, S&amp;P 500, and gold, and explore various strategies for risk and return optimization. Dive into portfolio management and analysis with this concise Python project

## Data
The data used for this project is the historical price data of Bitcoin, S&P 500, and Gold. The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance.

## Methodology
The following steps were used to compare the three different portfolios:

- The historical price data was used to calculate the returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio of each asset.
- The Max Sharpe Portfolio was constructed by maximizing the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio subject to a constraint on the portfolio's volatility.
- The Minimum Volatility Portfolio was constructed by minimizing the volatility of the portfolio subject to a constraint on the portfolio's return.
- The Equal Weight Portfolio was constructed by equally weighting each asset in the portfolio.
- A Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate 10,000 possible future returns for each portfolio.
- The results of the Monte Carlo simulation were used to compare the expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio of each portfolio.

## Results
The results of the Monte Carlo simulation showed that the Max Sharpe Portfolio had the highest expected return and Sharpe ratio, followed by the Minimum Volatility Portfolio and the Equal Weight Portfolio. The Max Sharpe Portfolio also had the lowest volatility of the three portfolios.

## Conclusion
The results of this project showed that the Max Sharpe Portfolio is the best performing portfolio in terms of expected return and Sharpe ratio. The Minimum Volatility Portfolio is a good choice for investors who are risk averse, while the Equal Weight Portfolio is a good choice for investors who want to diversify their portfolio.
